# tidychatmodels

![](tidychatmodels.png){width="400px"}

## About this package

This package provides a simple interface to chat with your favorite AI chatbot from R.
It is inspired by the modular nature of `{tidymodels}` where you can easily swap out any ML model for another one but keep the other parts of the workflow the same.
In the same vain, this package aims to communicate with different chatbot vendors like [openAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/making-requests), [mistral.ai](https://docs.mistral.ai/api/), etc. using the same interface.

Basically, this package is a wrapper around the API of different chatbots and provides a unified interface to communicate with them.
The underlying package that handles all the communication is the [`{httr2}`](https://httr2.r-lib.org/) package.
For a deep dive into `{httr2}`, you could check out one of my tutorials [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/hmtE4QGIOuk).

## Installation

Currently this package is only available on GitHub. To install it, you will need to use the `devtools` package.

```{.r}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AlbertRapp/tidychatmodels")
```

## Getting Started


What you will need to get started is an API key from the chatbot vendor you want to use.
For example, to use the openAI chatbot, you will need to sign up for an API key [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
Once you have that key, you can use it to authenticate with the openAI API.
I recommend saving the key into a `.env` file and loading the key into your R environment using the `{dotenv}` package.


```{r}
#| collapse: true
dotenv::load_dot_env('../.env')
library(tidychatmodels)
chat_openai <- create_chat('openai', Sys.getenv('OAI_DEV_KEY'))
chat_openai
```


Afterwards, you can add a model to the chat object. 
In this case, we are adding the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model.
The user is responsible for knowing which models are available at a vendor like OpenAI.

```{r}
chat_openai |>
  add_model('gpt-3.5-turbo')
```

Similarly, you can add parameters to the chat object.

```{r}
create_chat('openai', Sys.getenv('OAI_DEV_KEY'))|>
  add_model('gpt-3.5-turbo') |>
  add_params('temperature' = 0.5, 'max_tokens' = 100)
```

Afterwards, you can add messages to your chat object using different roles.
Typically, you might first use a system manage to set the stage for what you bot is required to do.
Afterwards, you can add a user message.


```{r}
chat_openai <- create_chat('openai', Sys.getenv('OAI_DEV_KEY'))|>
  add_model('gpt-3.5-turbo') |>
  add_params(temperature = 0.5, max_tokens = 100) |>
  add_message(
    role = 'system',
    message = 'You are a chatbot that completes texts.
    You do not return the full text.
    Just what you think completes the text.'
  ) |> 
  add_message(
    # default role = 'user'
    '2 + 2 is 4, minus 1 that\'s 3, '
  ) 
chat_openai
```

At this stage, you haven't actually started any chat with the bot.
You can do so by calling the `perform_chat` method.
Beware that this will consume your API calls and will likely incur costs.
Once the chat is performed, you can extract the chat from the chat object.

```{r}
chat_openai <- chat_openai |> perform_chat()
chat_openai |> extract_chat()
```

Excellent!
ChatGPT seems to know the next line of this [glorious song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3ujv8xdK2w&ab_channel=musiclyrics).
Also, you can save the chat into a tibble.
If you want to surpress the output of the chat, you can use the `silent` parameter.

```{r}
msgs <- chat_openai |> extract_chat(silent = TRUE)
msgs
```

You could add another message to the chat by adding a user message and then performing the chat again.
While we're at it, let's just modify the `temperature` parameter to for this new reply. 


```{r}
chat_openai <- chat_openai |> 
  add_message(
    role = 'user',
    message = 'Make it cooler!'
  ) |> 
  add_params(temperature = 0.9) |> 
  perform_chat()

chat_openai |> extract_chat()
```

Ah yes, that's much cooler.
But beware, this sent the whole chat again and consumed another API call.

### Switching to another vendor

Let's recap our full workflow.

```{r}
#| eval: false
create_chat('openai', Sys.getenv('OAI_DEV_KEY')) |>
  add_model('gpt-3.5-turbo') |>
  add_params(temperature = 0.5, max_tokens = 100) |>
  add_message(
    role = 'system',
    message = 'You are a chatbot that completes texts.
    You do not return the full text.
    Just what you think completes the text.'
  ) |> 
  add_message(
    # default role = 'user'
    '2 + 2 is 4, minus 1 that\'s 3, '
  ) |> 
  perform_chat()
```


You can easily switch so some other vendor now.
For example, let's go for the `mistral-large-latest` model from [Mistral.ai](https://docs.mistral.ai/api/).

```{r}
mistral_chat <- create_chat('mistral', Sys.getenv('MISTRAL_DEV_KEY')) |>
  add_model('mistral-large-latest') |>
  add_params(temperature = 0.5, max_tokens = 100) |>
  add_message(
    role = 'system',
    message = 'You are a chatbot that completes texts.
    You do not return the full text.
    Just what you think completes the text.'
  ) |> 
  add_message(
    # default role = 'user'
    '2 + 2 is 4, minus 1 that\'s 3, '
  ) |> 
  perform_chat()
mistral_chat |> extract_chat()
```

## Supported vendors

Currently only supported vendors are openAI, mistral.ai and [ollama](https://ollama.com/).
ollama allows you to deploy local LLMs and chat with them through `localhost`.
The ollama's API is a bit different but on our `tidychatmodels` interface everything should still works the same or be at least very similar.

For example, creating a chat works pretty much the same but doesn't require an API key.

```{r}
create_chat('ollama') 
```

Notice how there is already a parameter `stream` that is set to `false`.
This is a change in the API of the ollama chat engine.
You see, by default ollama will stream the reply token by token.
But `{httr2}` doesn't want that (or rather I didn't bother looking into how to do that with `{httr2}`).
So that's why by default we set `stream` to `false`.

Now, you can add a local model to your chat.
So, assume that you ran (outside of R)

```{.r}
ollama pull gemma:7b
```

Then you can add the model to your chat object.

```{r}
create_chat('ollama') |>
  add_model('gemma:7b')
```

And just like before, you can add messages and perform the chat.
Beware though that for some models system messages are not actually working like for openAI or mistral.ai models.
So here I've only added a user message.

```{r}
ollama_chat <- create_chat('ollama') |>
  add_model('gemma:7b') |> 
  add_message('What is love? IN 10 WORDS.') |> 
  perform_chat() 

ollama_chat |> 
  extract_chat()
```

And adding more messages works too.

```{r}
ollama_chat <- ollama_chat |> 
  add_message('Now describe hate in 10 words') |> 
  perform_chat() 

ollama_chat |> 
  extract_chat()
```


```{r}
msgs <- ollama_chat |> extract_chat()

ollama_chat |> 
  add_message(
    paste(
      'You said: "',
      msgs$message[2], 
      msgs$message[4],
      '" Is there a relationship between these two?'
    )
  ) |> 
  perform_chat() |> 
  extract_chat()
```

### Configuring Azure OpenAI

To use Azure OpenAI with `tidychatmodels`, you need to provide your Azure OpenAI credentials. You can do this by setting the following environment variables:

- `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY`: Your Azure OpenAI API key.
- `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`: The endpoint URL for your Azure OpenAI resource.
- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION`: The API version to use (e.g., "2023-03-15-preview").
- `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`: The name of your Azure OpenAI deployment.
- `AZURE_OPENAI_TASK`: The task type (e.g., "completion" or "chat").
- `AZURE_OPENAI_USE_TOKEN` (optional): Set to "true" if you want to use an access token instead of an API key.
- `AZURE_OPENAI_TENANT_ID` (optional): Your Azure tenant ID, required if using an access token.
- `AZURE_OPENAI_CLIENT_ID` (optional): Your Azure client ID, required if using an access token.
- `AZURE_OPENAI_CLIENT_SECRET` (optional): Your Azure client secret, required if using an access token.

You can set these environment variables in your `.Renviron` file, using `Sys.setenv()` in your R script, or using `.env` file along with the `{dotenv}` package as described in the previous section.

The `config_list_azure()` function is used internally by `tidychatmodels` to retrieve the Azure OpenAI configuration from the environment variables. You don't need to call this function directly if you environmental variables are set.

If you set `AZURE_OPENAI_USE_TOKEN` to "true", `tidychatmodels` will use the `retrieve_azure_token()` function to obtain an access token using your Azure tenant ID, client ID, and client secret. This is useful in cases where you need to use an access token instead of an API key for authentication.

Note that you only need to provide the token-related arguments (`AZURE_OPENAI_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_OPENAI_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_OPENAI_CLIENT_SECRET`) if you are using an access token for authentication. If you are using an API key, you can omit these arguments.

Once you have set the required environment variables, you can use `create_chat('azure')` to create a chat object for Azure OpenAI, similar to how you would use other vendors like OpenAI or Mistral.ai.
