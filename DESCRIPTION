    person("Albert", "Rapp", , "info@albert-rapp.de", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This packages lets you chat with models from openAI and
    mistral.ai really easily.  This package is set up in a modular fashion
    (similar to {tidymodels}) so that it is easy to switch between using
    any model from openAI, mistral.ai and in the future hopefully other
    model providers.
